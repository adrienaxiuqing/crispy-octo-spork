<h1 style=text-align:center;>Adriena's Social Media Detox</h1>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Date: 6/26</p>

<p>I've decided to take a week-long break from social media. I have deleted Instagram, Reddit, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and Twitter from my phone. I'm keeping Snapchat for my streaks, but I might make someone else keep those? I'm not sure yet. I'm trying to be more positive in my day to day life. I feel like social media is a huge contributor to negative energy so I'm getting rid of it for a little while. I dislike the fact that I care so much about what strangers think. I'm hoping that taking a break will lengthen my attention span, allow me to focus on more important things, and force me to live life a little more genuinely.</p>

<p>It already feels like a weight has been lifted. I feel good about this. Right now I'm a little tired. I still have to walk to my house before going to Sam's. I'm hoping the bus will work out even though I think I only have $2.00 left on my Orca card. I guess we'll find out!</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Date: 6/27</p>

<p>I got called in to work the front desk today so there is plenty of space for would-be social media surfing. I've found myself going to click on apps out of habit, but for the most part, I haven't found it too difficult to stay away from social media. I've started reading the news in place of that, but I'm worried that the news is going to be a source of negativity too. We'll see.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p>Date: 6/28</p>

<p>Staying away really hasn't been that hard. I don't know why I didn't do this earlier.</p>

<h2>Day 4, 5, and 6</h2>
<p>Date: 6/29-7/1</p>

<p>I will admit that I had to take a few peeks at Facebook this weekend. A project I was working on underwent a few developments that I wanted to see. I'm also in contact with someone concerning the place I'm subletting so I checked to see if she had gotten back to me. At this point, I'm just going to do my own thing and let her figure it out. My dad is going to help me move around August 10th and she can deal with it from there.
<div>As far as social media goes, I haven't really missed it. Instead, I've been enjoying myself and my moments as they come and go. I haven't felt a need to share or post. People can do what they're doing, I don't have to know about it and I can do what I want without letting everyone know that I'm doing it. Sam and I had a great time this weekend, I helped her at her work and we went to Pride for a bit. I like being in my own world, I like living organically and free of other people's opinions.
